"""Two-hand gestures as an explicit relationship between two ``HandState`` snapshots.

Deliberately does not just run the single-hand classifier twice and guess: a
two-hand gesture is only recognized from *relational* features (centroid
distance and its change over time) combined with pose agreement between the
two hands, not from either hand's pose alone.
